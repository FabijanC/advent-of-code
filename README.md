My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## TODO

- Find where I saved the solutions to years 2017, 2019, 2020
- Solve part 2 of day 23 of year 2018
- Improve solution to day 13 of year 2022 by using JSON crate
- Improve solution to day 16 of year 2022 by merging zero-rate valves
- Solve part 2 of day 23 of year 2016 by simplifying the input code instead of leaving the program to run for 5.5 minutes
- Solve part 2 of day 5 of year 2023 by splitting the biggest range (just one range would effectively halve the execution time)
  - An approach that is not suboptimal involves operating on ranges, but I left that to smarter people
